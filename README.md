## 🛡 Security Notes

While the contract follows security best practices, it has **not been formally audited**. It is deployed as-is, with the following recommendations for contributors:

- ✅ Consider SafeMath or OpenZeppelin libraries for enhanced audit readability.
- ✅ Add automated tests using Hardhat or Foundry.
- ✅ Review logic around `approve()` and race conditions.
- ✅ Verify contract ownership and pause control are safely managed.
